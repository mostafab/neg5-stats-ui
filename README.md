### Getting Started
1. Run `./bin/setup_environment.sh` to setup your dev environment. This script configures the project with the correct version of Node, installs npm dependencies,
and creates a `.env` file at the root of your directory used to load environment variables into the application. This file isn't checked into Git.
2. In your terminal session, run `nvm use 16.18.1` (or whichever Node version is printed by the output of step 1). You'll need to re-run this command if you exit the terminal session.
3. Start the server with `npm start`.
